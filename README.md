📊 Swiggy Funnel Conversion & Traffic Analysis
🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes weekly order fluctuations by examining:

1. Traffic change vs same day last week

2. Overall funnel conversion trends

3. Stage-wise conversion (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O)

4. High vs Low performance days

The objective was to identify whether order volatility is driven by traffic acquisition or conversion efficiency.

📁 Dataset Structure

* Session / Traffic Data

* Weekly Order Change Analysis

* Stage-wise Conversion Breakdown

* High vs Low Fluctuation Tagging

📈 Analysis Performed
1. Traffic vs Orders Comparison

Evaluated whether order movement was proportional to traffic changes.

2. Funnel Conversion Analysis

Measured overall conversion % and stage-level volatility.

3. Stage Sensitivity Assessment

Identified which funnel stage contributes most to performance instability.

🔎 Key Insights

* Large order drops correlate strongly with major traffic decline.

* Moderate order volatility often occurs despite stable traffic, indicating conversion impact.

* M2C (Menu → Cart) is the most volatile stage and primary instability driver.

* Checkout and payment stages show periodic friction affecting final orders.

🛠 Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel

* Pivot Tables

* KPI & Funnel Calculations

* Week-over-Week Performance Analysis

💼 Business Value
